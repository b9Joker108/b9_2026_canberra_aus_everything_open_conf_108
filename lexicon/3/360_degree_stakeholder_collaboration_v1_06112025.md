Please triangulate a detailed definition: "360°-stakeholder collaboration"

A detailed, triangulated definition of "360°-stakeholder collaboration" synthesizes three authoritative perspectives from stakeholder engagement, organizational network theory, and collaborative project management:

***

### 1. **Holistic Network Mapping**
“360°-stakeholder collaboration” describes an approach in which all relevant stakeholders—internal and external—are engaged in reciprocal, networked participation surrounding a focal organization, initiative, or project [1]. The “360°” metaphor signifies a full-circle view, meaning that each stakeholder’s relationships, interests, and influence are considered in relation to all other stakeholders, creating a dynamic network rather than a linear influence chain.

- It involves mapping direct and indirect relationships, concerns, and social ties among all parties to inform strategy and ensure no perspectives are omitted [1][4].

***

### 2. **Continuous Mutual Engagement**
The concept embodies a continual, multi-directional process where stakeholders actively collaborate—including sharing visions, feedback, expertise, resources, and responsibility—towards shared goals or resolving common challenges [3]. 

- Collaboration is not hierarchical but distributive: each stakeholder is both a contributor and beneficiary.
- Techniques include participatory workshops, joint decision-making sessions, transparent feedback reporting, and co-created action plans [3][8].

***

### 3. **Inclusive, Strategic Decision-Making**
“360°” highlights the integration of feedback, assessments, and information from all roles: leaders, team members, partners, regulators, users, and the affected community [7][9]. It requires:

- Systematic identification and analysis of stakeholders’ needs, power, and interests [6].
- Aligning expectations, ensuring transparent communication, and incorporating input to guide collective decisions and solutions.
- The feedback loop and collaboration strategy enhance legitimacy, social capital, and project outcomes, minimizing stakeholder risk and maximizing collective benefit [1][3][7].

A “360°-stakeholder collaboration” thus refers to a participatory, system-wide model in which all stakeholders are included in transparent dialogue, feedback, and co-creation, continuously, so mutual interests and concerns inform shared outcomes. This approach is increasingly used in sustainability, governance, smart city design, and technology standards formation [1][3][7].
