The collection of texts focuses on the **Epoch of the Sensate**, proposing **sovereign sensor networks** as a foundational technological paradigm comparable to historical breakthroughs like fire or the silicon chip. This future relies on embedding **distributed, autonomous intelligence** (Sovereign Edge Computing) directly into physical assets to create a secure, self-aware technological fabric. A critical component is the integration of **blockchain technology** to ensure immutable **data sovereignty** and provenance, which is necessary for validated measurement in addressing complex issues like the **Metacrises**, poverty, and social justice. The sources explore the technical challenges of this convergence, including the need for new standards in wireless telemetry, AI governance, and secure firmware, while philosophically advocating for the ethical stewardship of technology and the extension of sovereignty to ecological systems.
