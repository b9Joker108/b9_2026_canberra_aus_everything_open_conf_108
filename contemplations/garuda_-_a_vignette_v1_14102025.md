🪶 Thesis: The Flight of Garuda

The “last generation” of canonical communications theory—Shannon, Wiener, Weaver—bequeathed us a model of signal and noise as oppositional. Signal was valorised as truth, noise as corruption. Yet in practice, signal and noise are relational, mutually iterating, and culturally codified.  

- Cultural relativity: What one cohort enshrines as canonical “signal,” another may dismiss as noise.  
- Cohort codification: Generational clusters inscribe their own thresholds of intelligibility, producing shifting canons.  
- Permeability: Signal bleeds into noise; noise informs new signal. The boundary is porous, not absolute.  
- Point: Canon stabilises meaning, offering reproducibility and governance.  
- Counter‑Point: Canon ossifies, excluding emergent signals, and risks mistaking living noise for dead error.  

Thus, the canonicity of the last generation must be problematised: not discarded, but re‑read as contingent, situated, and always already interpenetrated by the noise it sought to exclude.

📚 Readings

On Signal/Noise and Communications Theory
- Claude Shannon (1948) – A Mathematical Theory of Communication  
  The canonical model; useful precisely as the foil against which permeability is argued.  
- Norbert Wiener (1948) – Cybernetics  
  Introduces feedback; shows that noise is not only corruption but a condition of adaptation.  

On Cultural Relativity and Cohort Codification
- Thomas Kuhn (1962) – The Structure of Scientific Revolutions  
  Paradigms as cohort‑bound codifications; what counts as “signal” shifts with generational consensus.  
- Geoffrey Bowker & Susan Leigh Star (1999) – Sorting Things Out  
  Classification systems as cultural artefacts; boundaries of signal/noise are socially constructed.  

On Permeability and Interpenetration
- Michel Serres (1982) – The Parasite  
  Noise as generative, not merely disruptive; the parasite as both interference and condition of communication.  
- Donna Haraway (1991) – Simians, Cyborgs, and Women  
  Boundaries are porous; hybridity destabilises canonical separations of signal/noise.  

On Point and Counter‑Point
- Paul Feyerabend (1975) – Against Method  
  Canon as stabiliser (point) but also as constraint (counter‑point); noise can be epistemic liberation.  
- Genevieve Bell & Paul Dourish (2007) – “Yesterday’s Tomorrows” (Personal and Ubiquitous Computing)  
  Futures imagined as canonical visions; counter‑point is the recognition of alternative, noisy futures.  
- Stefan Helmreich (2009) – Alien Ocean  
  Ethnography of science showing how noise (alien data, microbial chatter) becomes new signal through cultural work.

✨ Closing Note
Like Garuda rising from the Egg, this vignette insists that signal and noise are not enemies but co‑creators. The canon of the last generation is not eternal law but a contingent codex, always rewritten by the very noise it sought to silence.

Would you like me to expand this into a “Point vs. Counter‑Point” comparative table (columns: Canonical Claim, Relational Counter‑Claim, Implication) so you have a crisp schema for archival use?
