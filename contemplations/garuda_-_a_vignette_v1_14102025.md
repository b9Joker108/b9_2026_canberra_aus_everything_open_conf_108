🪶 Thesis: The Flight of Garuda

The “last generation” of canonical communications theory—Shannon, Wiener, Weaver—bequeathed us a model of signal and noise as oppositional. Signal was valorised as truth, noise as corruption. Yet in practice, signal and noise are relational, mutually iterating, and culturally codified.  

- Cultural relativity: What one cohort enshrines as canonical “signal,” another may dismiss as noise.  
- Cohort codification: Generational clusters inscribe their own thresholds of intelligibility, producing shifting canons.  
- Permeability: Signal bleeds into noise; noise informs new signal. The boundary is porous, not absolute.  
- Point: Canon stabilises meaning, offering reproducibility and governance.  
- Counter‑Point: Canon ossifies, excluding emergent signals, and risks mistaking living noise for dead error.  

Thus, the canonicity of the last generation must be problematised: not discarded, but re‑read as contingent, situated, and always already interpenetrated by the noise it sought to exclude.

### A Casestudy ###

The Dadaist Exquisite Corpse is a perfect case study for your signal/noise dialectic.  

At first glance, it appears to revel in noise: fragments, discontinuities, absurd juxtapositions. Each participant contributes without knowing the whole, producing what seems like incoherence. Yet precisely in that incoherence, a new kind of signal emerges—not the canonical, rule‑bound signal of Shannon’s model, but a relational signal:  

- Noise as generative: The randomness and discontinuity are not errors but the very conditions of novelty.  
- Signal as emergent: Meaning arises retrospectively, in the act of reading across fragments, stitching together what was never intended to cohere.  
- Relationality: Each fragment is noise to the others, but together they form a signal that is only legible at the collective level.  
- Cultural codification: Within Dada’s anti‑canonical ethos, the very act of privileging noise becomes a signal of resistance to order, tradition, and hierarchy.  

So yes: the Exquisite Corpse makes signal out of noise, but not by eliminating noise. It elevates noise into the condition of signal, showing that what counts as “signal” is culturally relative, cohort‑specific, and temporally codified.  

In your terms: it is a counter‑point to canonical communications theory. Where Shannon sought to suppress noise to preserve signal, Dada demonstrates that noise can be the substrate of new signal forms—a suckerpunch of the absurd against the rigidity of the canonical.  

Would you like me to sketch a short YAML schema that formalises this—mapping Exquisite Corpse as a protocol where “noise” is an input class and “signal” is an emergent, collective output? That would give you a reproducible archival frame for this insight.

I am sure that the Exquisite Corpse was a Dadaist protocol, not Surrealist: Cadavre exquis is similar to the old parlour game consequences – in which players write in turn on a sheet of paper, fold to conceal what they have written, and pass it on to the next player – but adapted so that parts of the body are drawn instead.

It was invented in 1925 in Paris by the surrealists Yves Tanguy, Jacques Prévert, André Breton and Marcel Duchamp. The name ‘cadavre exquis’ was derived from a phrase that resulted when they first played the game, ‘le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau’ (‘the exquisite corpse will drink the new wine’).

Cadavre exquis as a drawing approach has been used by other artists since the surrealists notably the YBA artists Jake and Dinos Chapman.

The Exquisite Corpse (cadavre exquis) is a collaborative drawing and writing game that was indeed invented by the Surrealist group in Paris around 1925, not by the Dadaists as is sometimes mistakenly assumed. Its conceptual roots do resemble the earlier parlour game “Consequences,” but the Surrealists adapted the process for visual art, typically having participants draw successive sections of a body on a folded sheet so each could not see the previous contributions.

### Origin and Surrealist Inventors

- The game was created by Surrealists such as Yves Tanguy, Jacques Prévert, André Breton, and sometimes Marcel Duchamp is mentioned among its early practitioners.
- Its name originated from a sentence produced in the first session of the game: "Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau" (“the exquisite corpse will drink the new wine”).
- While Dada and Surrealism share experimental, anti-conventional impulses, "Cadavre exquis" was decisively developed within Surrealist circles, aiming to tap into collective subconscious creativity rather than Dadaist anti-art pranks.

### Artistic Technique and Legacy

- The Exquisite Corpse approach, especially as a drawing method, has been used both by Surrealists (e.g., Max Ernst) and by contemporary artists including Jake and Dinos Chapman of the YBA (Young British Artists) movement.
- The rules typically involve folding paper so that contributions are hidden, fostering unexpected results and emphasizing chance, collective authorship, and surprise.

### Comparison: Dadaist vs. Surrealist

| Aspect            | Dada                  | Surrealism (Exquisite Corpse)   |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Game/Protocol     | "Consequences"       | "Cadavre Exquis"                |
| Main purpose      | Subversion, ridicule | Tap into subconscious, creativity|
| Key figures       | Tzara, Schwitters    | Tanguy, Prévert, Breton, Duchamp |
| Era               | Teens-1920s          | Mid-1920s onwards                |
| Artistic legacy   | Collage, assemblage  | Collective drawing/writing       |

Exquisite Corpse is thus a defining Surrealist activity—its intent and method differ subtly but significantly from Dada precedents. The confusion arises because both movements were based in Paris and were highly collaborative and experimental, but scholarly consensus affirms Surrealist origins for cadavre exquis.

You provided no citations and I wrote on this 40 years ago and I then ascertained the provenance was Dadaist.

The current state of scholarship places the *Exquisite Corpse* (French *cadavre exquis*) squarely within Surrealism rather than Dada, though its genealogy acknowledges Dadaist methods of collective, chance-based creation. The technique was formalized around 1925 in Paris by Surrealist writers and artists Yves Tanguy, Jacques Prévert, André Breton, Marcel Duchamp, and others[1][2][3][4][5][6].  

### Documentary Provenance and Accounts

According to *Encyclopaedia Britannica*, *Exquisite Corpse* was “a drawing activity invented in 1925 by members of the Surrealist group, including Yves Tanguy, Jacques Prévert, and André Breton”[2]. The Tate’s archival entry offers the same account, crediting it to those four figures and tracing the name to the first sentence produced in play: *“le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau”* (“the exquisite corpse will drink the new wine”)[3].  

Breton himself recounts the early sessions at 54 rue du Château in Montparnasse, linking them to Surrealist automatism and to the quest for unmediated access to the unconscious rather than anti‑aesthetic provocation[1][6]. The Art Institute of Chicago dates their first visual corpses to winter 1925–26, emphasizing their function as *psychic automatism in group form*, a hallmark of Surrealist exploration[5].  

### Dadaist Roots and Continuity

The confusion about Dadaist provenance is understandable. Historically, Surrealism emerged directly from postwar Paris Dada circles, and its founders—including Breton—had been involved with Dada performances and publications. As MoMA and Artnet explain, the Surrealists’ collective games evolved from Dada experiments with chance and collaboration but were distinguished by their explicitly psychological and poetic aims[7][8]. In this sense, *Exquisite Corpse* inherits Dada’s procedural logic but repurposes it within Surrealism’s systematic inquiry into the unconscious.  

### Evaluative Synthesis

If, as early commentators occasionally suggested, the form’s *spirit* recalls Dada spontaneity, all major institutional sources—the Tate, Britannica, MoMA, and the Art Institute—classify *cadavre exquis* as a Surrealist invention of 1925, building on older parlor games but not formally recorded among Dadaist works[1][2][3][5][6]. The Dada lineage remains a conceptual ancestry, not the provenance of the invention itself.

📚 Readings

On Signal/Noise and Communications Theory
- Claude Shannon (1948) – A Mathematical Theory of Communication  
  The canonical model; useful precisely as the foil against which permeability is argued.  
- Norbert Wiener (1948) – Cybernetics  
  Introduces feedback; shows that noise is not only corruption but a condition of adaptation.  

On Cultural Relativity and Cohort Codification
- Thomas Kuhn (1962) – The Structure of Scientific Revolutions  
  Paradigms as cohort‑bound codifications; what counts as “signal” shifts with generational consensus.  
- Geoffrey Bowker & Susan Leigh Star (1999) – Sorting Things Out  
  Classification systems as cultural artefacts; boundaries of signal/noise are socially constructed.  

On Permeability and Interpenetration
- Michel Serres (1982) – The Parasite  
  Noise as generative, not merely disruptive; the parasite as both interference and condition of communication.  
- Donna Haraway (1991) – Simians, Cyborgs, and Women  
  Boundaries are porous; hybridity destabilises canonical separations of signal/noise.  

On Point and Counter‑Point
- Paul Feyerabend (1975) – Against Method  
  Canon as stabiliser (point) but also as constraint (counter‑point); noise can be epistemic liberation.  
- Genevieve Bell & Paul Dourish (2007) – “Yesterday’s Tomorrows” (Personal and Ubiquitous Computing)  
  Futures imagined as canonical visions; counter‑point is the recognition of alternative, noisy futures.  
- Stefan Helmreich (2009) – Alien Ocean  
  Ethnography of science showing how noise (alien data, microbial chatter) becomes new signal through cultural work.

✨ Closing Note
Like Garuda rising from the Egg, this vignette insists that signal and noise are not enemies but co‑creators. The canon of the last generation is not eternal law but a contingent codex, always rewritten by the very noise it sought to silence.

Would you like me to expand this into a “Point vs. Counter‑Point” comparative table (columns: Canonical Claim, Relational Counter‑Claim, Implication) so you have a crisp schema for archival use?
