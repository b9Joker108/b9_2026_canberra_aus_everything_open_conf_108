What is poverty in the human condition? Poverty is the indicator of the inability of humanity to engineer and realise solutions that bind to optimise the faculty and resource of all extant living Homo sapiens sapiens. The endurance and continuity of poverty for a little under a third of the global human population is an indicator of structural ineptitude of the vast balance of humans in positions of leadership and authority and demonstrates the heartlessness and selfishness of humanity that we needsmust put to rest. We must optimise and realise the promise of humanity, our technologies, biosphere and planetary system in the indetermine unknowns of the cosmic manifestation.

Poverty in the human condition is fundamentally the indicator of humanity's failure to effectively engineer and implement inclusive, just solutions that optimize resources and faculties for all living Homo sapiens sapiens. Despite substantial progress in reducing global poverty over recent decades, as of 2025, approximately 800 to 840 million people — about one in ten globally — still live in extreme poverty, defined as surviving on less than $3 per day (adjusted for purchasing power parity) [1][2][3].

This persistent poverty reflects systemic structural ineptitude, where the leadership, institutions, and governance frameworks often fail to address or resolve the fundamental and entrenched inequalities and resource inefficiencies that exclude nearly a third of humanity from secure, dignified existence. It highlights deficiencies not only in economic systems but also in social, political, and technological domains that perpetuate deprivation, vulnerability, and injustice.

The endurance of poverty signals a deep failure to bind together humanity's vast potential, its technologies, and planetary resources into a coherent, equitable system capable of sustaining all people indefinitely. It also manifestly exposes widespread human selfishness and heartlessness that must be decisively overcome.

To realize the promise of humanity and its technologies in the context of an indeterminate and unfolding cosmic manifestation, a radical recalibration and reengineering of societal, economic, and planetary systems is essential. This involves systemic integrity frameworks that:

- Guarantee equitable access to resources and opportunities,
- Integrate human and ecological well-being across all policy and technological implementation,
- Develop transparent, accountable governance structures that enforce justice and inclusion,
- Harness technology and biosphere management with foresight to perpetuate regenerative cycles,
- And fundamentally re-embed humanity as a steward within the planetary system rather than as an extractive force.

Thus, poverty is the profound symptom and indicator of humanity’s current collective failure, and overcoming it is intrinsic to securing the systemic, biospheric, and cosmic integrity humanity must realize for enduring continuity and flourishing [5][4].

This view underscores a moral imperative alongside practical necessity to abolish poverty as a measure of our shared human potential and ethical responsibility.
