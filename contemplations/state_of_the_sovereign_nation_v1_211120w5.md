**I need a free and open source application that downloads every state of every online Terms-and-Conditions (T&Cs) and subsidiary documentation too in-state, etc., et al., that I digitally sign: Has any work on this been done? Triangulate; Survey; Report! Hari Aum Tat Sat Svaha A FFF|**

Yes, there is a significant open source initiative already addressing the archival and versioning of online Terms-and-Conditions (T&Cs) and subsidiary documentation, enabling democratic oversight and detailed tracking of changes over time[1][2][3].

### Key Project: Open Terms Archive

- **Open Terms Archive** is a free, open-source project that records every version of the terms of digital services, including T&Cs and related documents, so that all changes are permanently archived and exposed to public and legal scrutiny[1][2].
- The platform aggregates, indexes, and enables comparison between states/versions, supporting in-depth audits, legal reviews, or research projects.
- It offers decentralized crawling and archiving infrastructure to maximize resilience and independence from any single organization[3].
- The archive is accessible both through their website and via open source infrastructure, with active GitHub repositories providing community development and documentation[2][3].

### Technical and Academic Context

- Archival and legal literature underscores the critical need for "life-cycle management" of records, including legal documents like T&Cs. Effective records management acts and frameworks propose tracking documents from creation, through every amendment, to final disposal or archival[4][5][6].
- The Open Terms Archive stands out for addressing the lack of accessible versioning in most commercial platforms and directly targeting the transparency of contract and policy documentation, compared to purely governmental or records legislation-based archives[1][2][3].

### Related Projects and Survey

- General-purpose code and data archiving efforts exist, such as Software Heritage, but their Terms of Use explicitly restrict massive extraction of archival content and are geared toward source code archival[7].
- Some commercial software (like jSparrow) offers terms for users to download copies of current contractual documentation, but this is not designed for systematic or universal archival of all versions/states[8].
- Academic and legislative models advocate for robust systems to manage official records, but do not specifically address the automated, open-source, multi-version online T&Cs domain covered by Open Terms Archive[4][5][6].

### Open Source and Community Development

- The Open Terms Archive's GitHub repository enables contributors to participate in building scrapers, archiving bots, and analysis tools for ongoing improvement and broader coverage[2][3].
- Documentation and technical onboarding for decentralization, integration with research workflows, and public policy engagement is actively maintained[3].

***

**In summary:** Open Terms Archive is the premier open source project for comprehensively archiving every state and change of online T&Cs and subsidiary texts, with active development, clear documentation, and strong alignment with legal and transparency goals. This surpasses most legislative or commercial solutions in openness and archival scope[1][2][3][4].
