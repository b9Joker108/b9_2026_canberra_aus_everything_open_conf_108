Please triangulate, qualify and quantify, the MIT Labs fabricator tool: A tool that can not only manufacture almost any component or tool, presently known, out of a vast amount of canonical materials, but also from new and emergent materials science at all different scales and orders of size.

The MIT Labs "fabricator" tools collectively refer to advanced, highly-adaptable fabrication platforms that integrate software and hardware capable of manufacturing a vast range of components—spanning canonical, new, and emergent materials—across scales from macro to nano-level[1][2][3][4][5]. These platforms leverage both traditional fabrication and cutting-edge materials intelligence, enabling not just replication but genuine invention of objects and processes.

### Core Capabilities and Scope

MIT Labs' fabrication ecosystem includes micro- and nanofabrication facilities (notably MIT.nano), additive and subtractive manufacturing (FDM, DMLS, Directed Energy Deposition), plus software platforms like Fab Modules and MODS that support streamlined toolpath workflows from design to machine control[1][2][3][6]. There is an emphasis on open-source software, accessible interfaces, and the capacity for both prototyping and scalable production up to 200mm industry-standard wafers[3][7].

### Materials Supported

MIT systems can fabricate using:

- A comprehensive catalog of thermoplastics (ABS, Nylon, PEEK, filled composites)[2][6]
- Most metals in powder form for alloy development and part creation (from steel to high-temp refractory alloys)[2][3]
- Silicon and semiconductor materials at the wafer scale (for electronics, batteries, sensors)[3]
- Novel quantum and AI-invented materials through generative design and machine learning-augmented pipelines, now extended to quantum and functional materials with exotic traits (e.g., quantum spin liquids)[4][8]

### Manufacturing Scales and Orders

These tools operate:

- From large format FDM printers (up to ~406 x 355 x 406 mm build volumes)[2][6]
- Down to micron and nanometer feature sizes with L-PBF and nanofabrication lines, suitable for electronics, sensors, and precision engineered structures (e.g., 45 micron features on metals)[2][3][7]

### Automation, Discovery, and Networking

MIT’s facilities are deeply networked, supporting global fab labs linked for collaborative invention and enabling distributed manufacturing and blueprint sharing[9][5]. High-throughput automation, machine learning, and AI are embedded for material property prediction, process optimization, and the creation of entirely new classes of materials using computational design and closed-loop experimental validation[8][4].

### Qualifications and Limitations

- While proven for rapid prototyping, process debugging, and efficient scaling to industry-standard wafer sizes, the platforms still rely on experimental validation for AI-generated and quantum materials[4].
- Some systems are only accessible ad hoc and require advanced training due to complexity and safety (e.g., metal powder systems, nano fabrication lines)[2][3].
- For truly novel, emergent materials, the bottleneck remains not in design but in physical synthesis and property verification[4].
