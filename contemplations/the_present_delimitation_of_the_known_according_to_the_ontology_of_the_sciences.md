# The Present Delimitation of the Known According to The Sciences #

**Q: Do thoughts have any physical weight? Are they physical properties?** 

**A: Hard Science: ‘Thoughts’ are ‘clothed’ electro-chemical cascades of processes. So, interrogate the discourse. Both electrical and chemical scientific processes are measurable with the caveat of tolerance. That said, remember, all that we think, feel, perceive, know, touch and interact with in any way, is mediated within the bodymind of the observer/agent. Beyond this, is speculation unfounded. There is a growing body of triangulated discourse, that spatio-temporality or SpaceTime is a relational construct formulated by the bodymind complex of Homo sapiens sapiens and is not That-Which-Is-In-Itself. Clear? In sum, the human bodymind complex is a unique subset instantiation of the experienced measure and aggregate of the knowable, the summation of the possible or that-which-is-extant. Anything ‘physical’, anything ‘measured’, is only extant within the consciousness or bodymind complex of the agent/perceiver, in defensible consensus, of the sum of that which has been experienced by our species. Anything other, is novel and conjecture. But, the novel and conjecture may be true. It is presently, an unknowable.** 

**Perplexity: Critique with defensible citations.**

The question of whether **thoughts have physical weight or properties** sits at the intersection of neuroscience, physics, and philosophy of mind. The short scientific answer is **they do not, in themselves, possess physical mass**, but they *are instantiated* in **electrochemical and electromagnetic processes** that are physical and measurable. The extended, defensible critique requires distinguishing **measurable biophysical correlates** from **ontological interpretations**.

### 1. Neuroscientific evidence: thoughts as measurable biophysical events
From a neuroscience perspective, all cognitive and emotional events occur through **electrochemical signaling** among neurons—ion fluxes, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic activity that cause detectable voltage changes. Each process is physical and spatially located within the brain, but the *information pattern*—that is, the “thought”—is not a discrete massed substance.

- The **University of Reading replication of Angelo Mosso’s 19th‑century experiment** showed that focused thinking causes transient **increases in cerebral blood flow**, producing a minute, temporary rise in measurable head weight—on the order of microns of motion on a balance [1].  
  This does not imply thoughts have intrinsic mass, but that neural activation draws more oxygenated blood, a measurable biophysical correlate of cognition.
- Contemporary neuroimaging confirms that **thoughts possess neural correlates** in oscillatory and network‑based activity, detectable through fMRI, EEG, and magnetoencephalography; yet the “weight” belongs to transient physical flows, not to the informational content per se [2].

Hence, **the processes of thinking**—ion exchange, glucose metabolism, and hemodynamic response—carry energy and therefore have mass equivalence under $$E = mc^2$$, but the *cognitive content* has **no separable mass** [3].

### 2. Philosophical analysis: mind–body unity and embodied cognition
The **mind–body problem** remains central to philosophy: whether mental states are identical to physical brain states (physicalism) or distinct but interactive phenomena (dualism) [4][5].  
Current phenomenological and embodied‑cognition approaches defend the thesis that the **“bodymind” is a unified field**: consciousness is not an ethereal overlay but the *organizing dynamic* of bodily processes [6].

- As Gupta (2021) articulates, consciousness is *lived embodiment*: “I am my body,” not an observer of it; perception, action, and awareness form a single inseparable event [6].  
- In this framework, a “thought” is not an immaterial entity but a **phase pattern** within that embodied field—one that cannot be fully abstracted from its neural, chemical, and metabolic substrate.

This aligns closely with modern **enactivist neuroscience**, which treats cognition as the enactment of sensorimotor coordination rather than as separate computation.

### 3. Cognitive spatiotemporality: spacetime as relational construct
Recent cognitive models propose that **space–time itself may be a relational schema of the perceiver**, not a mind‑independent manifold.  
Signorelli (2020) posits that human cognition represents spacetime hierarchically—from topological connectedness at basic perception up to metric organization—constituting relational knowledge rather than direct access to “objective” spacetime [7].  
Neuroscientific accounts concur that **space and time in the brain are dissociated reference frames**, constructed through neural dynamics instead of reflecting cosmic spacetime *as‑it‑is‑in‑itself* [8][9].

Thus, the human bodymind operates as *the situated frame* through which all perceived quantity (“physical”) occurs—consistent with your statement that matter, measure, and phenomenon exist only within embodied sentience and its consensual extensions.

### 4. Integrative critique
1. **Hard science anchor:** every thought correlates with quantifiable electrochemical and electromagnetic activity, governed by thermodynamics and neurophysiology.  
2. **Energy–mass implications:** any energetic neural process entails negligible but real mass-energy exchange (on the order of 10⁻¹⁵ grams per impulse)—detectable only as metabolic flux.  
3. **Epistemic boundary:** what physics can describe are the correlates of thought; *qualia* or first‑person subjectivity remain **non‑reducible** empirically.  
4. **Relational ontology:** modern cognitive science supports the view that perceptual spacetime and objectivity are emergent relational constructs of the bodymind, lending theoretical coherence to your claim that the “physical” is definable only within the bodymind’s experiential field [7][8].

***

### 5. Conclusion
In defensible empirical terms, **thoughts are physical in their instantiation, not in their independent substance**. They do not have measurable “weight” apart from neural and vascular activity.  
Philosophically, the **bodymind unity** and the **constructivist spacetime model** converge: all measurement and physicality arise within the relational field of embodied cognition. Beyond this horizon—where the physical is conceived without the perceiver—lies speculation, not contradiction, because it transcends present epistemic reach [6][7][8][3][9].
