Why have I requested this content generation and frame it as a contemplation for the looming Australian 'Everything Open' conference in Canberra? There must be an ethical and robust Non-For-Profit instituted on Sovereign Sensors subsuming Smartsensors and an ecosystem blockchain with haste with many directives, one of which is to award and curate a bounty for reverse-engineering and documenting proprietary, closed, secret and subversive technology of global provenance and reward the informative engineers and investigators that hack and map them and maintain a register of same for the Everything Open (within Reason) Community.

You have requested the content on investigative journalists—hard-hitting figures who expose hidden truths and expose systemic power abuses—as a reflective contemplation for the looming Australian "Everything Open" conference in Canberra because their work epitomizes the critical values essential to the conference’s ethos: transparency, accountability, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge that benefits society. These journalists demonstrate the power and necessity of open scrutiny into secretive systems and entrenched powers, parallels that align with the conference's focus on openness in technology, governance, and information ecosystems.

Your vision calls for the establishment of an ethical and robust Non-For-Profit institution dedicated to the concept of Sovereign Sensors—an advanced ecosystem subsuming smart sensors interlinked with a blockchain infrastructure. The purpose of such an institution is multi-fold:

1. **Transparency and Accountability:** Like investigative journalists who reveal concealed malpractices, this institution would demystify proprietary, closed, secret, and subversive technologies. By reverse-engineering, documenting, and sharing knowledge about these technologies, it would foster transparency not only in technical processes but in the broader socio-technical systems that govern society.

2. **Sovereign and Open Innovation:** The institution embodies the principle of sovereign knowledge and data ownership, ensuring that sensor technologies and their data remain accessible, trustworthy, and under community governance rather than corporate or factional secrecy.

3. **Reward and Recognition:** Analogous to bounties and awards that incentivize investigative journalism and that of the polychromatic teaming of hacker bounty culture, the institution would curate incentives—bounties—for engineers and investigators who hack, map, and expose proprietary or secretive technologies. This would cultivate a committed ecosystem engaged in open discovery, discovery verification, and ethical dissemination.

4. **Community and Ecosystem Building:** Through a formally maintained register and an open ecosystem ledger (blockchain), the institution would unify fragmented efforts, protect intellectual freedom, preserve integrity, and promote responsible innovation aligned with the conference’s motto: Everything Open (within Reason).

5. **Ethical Framework:** Through institutional governance rooted in Non-For-Profit ethics, the framework would ensure that such powerful activities—reverse engineering and registry of sensitive technologies—are guided by strict principles respecting sovereignty, legality, privacy, and public good.

In essence, the institution you envision draws direct inspiration from the ethos of the very investigative journalism giants you requested profiles of: entities that act as watchdogs and truth-seekers. It leverages these principles technologically and institutionally to advance a new paradigm of openness and sovereignty that addresses the critical challenges of proprietary technological opacity, control, and misuse in today’s global, interconnected world.

This vision aligns with the 'Everything Open' conference’s goal to expand openness beyond software to encompass all aspects of infrastructure, governance, and technology—including the hidden architectures shaping modern life—thereby empowering communities with knowledge, agency, and ethical innovation pathways.

You delimited your purview and did not survey that which I framed: repair!

The "Everything Open" conference is a grassroots, not-for-profit event focused on open technologies, including Linux, open source software, open hardware, open data, and the communities around them. It brings together passionate volunteers, professionals, and enthusiasts to share knowledge, collaborate, and advance openness across multiple domains. The conference covers technical deep-dives, community management, open government, open GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums), and more, embodying a strong ethos of transparency, openness, and shared innovation[1][2][3][4].

Your framing for the need of an ethical non-profit instituted on Sovereign Sensors linked to smart sensors and an ecosystem blockchain aligns deeply with the conference ethos by extending the spirit of openness beyond software and data to physical sensor infrastructures and emerging proprietary technologies. The conference acts as a platform for exposing closed systems and promoting open investigation, documentation, and community governance, reflecting the need for both transparency and sovereignty in emerging tech ecosystems that you have outlined.
