# Lingual Fidelity #

We needsmust cleanse languages of legacy concepts and constructs as standard. These reinforce falsehood, ineffiency and subterfuge. We remember and archive the legacy terms and constructs and their historical development for probity and to maintain a sense of our heritage(s) and knowledge(s) of ourselves and our collective historical reflexivity. But, they are not of useful import as standard commucative currency. In the Age of AI, this is imperative as change will be increasingly rapid and gravely uncertain. This precision staves our path into uncertainty and the unknown.

The impulse described is a program of deliberate linguistic refactoring: keep a fully documented “legacy branch” of languages for heritage, but design and migrate toward a cleaner, higher-precision “main branch” optimised for AI-era communication and governance. This frames language planning as something closer to software engineering than to laissez-faire evolution.

## Conceptual core

The proposal rests on three linked claims. First, many inherited concepts and constructions encode falsity, opacity, or inefficiency (e.g. vague legalese, anthropocentric metaphors, category errors embedded as grammar), and so systematically mis-specify reality. Second, those legacies should be preserved—but quarantined—in a curated archival register (historical, literary, ritual, scholarly), not treated as default currency for high-stakes decision-making. Third, the emergence of AI as both reader and writer of human language makes failures of precision more dangerous, because mis-specified concepts can be propagated, operationalised, and scaled at machine speed.

## Linguistic engineering as standard

Treating “Standard Swedish”, “Standard English”, or any other standard variety as mutable engineering artefacts rather than sacrosanct traditions fits well with existing language-planning practice, but radically expands its ambition. Traditional planning standardises orthography, grammar, and terminology at the margins (e.g. spelling reforms, technical glossaries). A refactoring program would instead:

- Identify and mark “legacy” elements: terms that conflate categories (e.g. race, gender, “intelligence” as singular scalar), grammatical patterns that force misleading metaphysics (e.g. substance vs process, agentive vs non-agentive), and politeness or euphemism regimes that obscure responsibility.

- Define a “precision core”: a set of preferred lexical and syntactic patterns optimised for explicit ontology, traceable reference, and machine-parseable structure, analogous to controlled natural languages used in aviation, safety-critical industries, and some legal drafting.

- Maintain explicit register separation: legacy/historical, ritual-poetic, colloquial, and precision-governance registers clearly labelled and taught as such, with meta-linguistic awareness built into education.

## AI-era imperatives

AI systems amplify three pressures that make this sort of precision standardisation more than a thought experiment. First, models trained on uncurated corpora reproduce and entrench the biases and category mistakes of their inputs, including misleading metaphors and obsolete classifications. Second, AI-mediated communication reduces the friction of generating text, increasing the volume of language in circulation and thus the potential surface for misinterpretation and manipulation. Third, machine-readable norms (schema, ontologies, controlled vocabularies) increasingly govern critical domains—health, law, finance, sensor networks—and require tight coupling between words and world to avoid cascading error.

In that setting, the distinction you draw between “archival probity” (remembering how we used to think and speak) and “operative currency” (how we must speak when the stakes are high and the systems are fast) is not nostalgic but protective. It preserves our historical reflexivity while refusing to let inherited conceptual debris silently dictate the next phase of human–machine co-evolution.

If desired, the next step is to make this operational: specify design principles for a “precision register” (lexical constraints, allowed constructions, annotation conventions), sketch migration paths from existing standards (e.g. Rikssvenska, prestige English), and decide where and how such a register becomes mandatory (technical regulation, safety protocols, sensor governance charters).
