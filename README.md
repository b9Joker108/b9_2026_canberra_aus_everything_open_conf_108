## Grave Warning and Peril ##

Almost two (2) months ago, I saw Dune 3 'The Messiah' on my YouTube feed. It ran for over three (3) hours. I only watched just over 1.5 hours as I had been very busy and was exhausted and needed to take refuge and sanctuary in sleep and dream. The next late afternoon, when I was due for some downtime, I looked for the movie. It had disappeared from my viewing History and the publishing channel was no longer extant. I love cinema. I critique it. Cinema is a meta-discipline, like Architecture. I love meta-disciplines. I have seen the first two (2) features of this cinematic reboot. This, third installment, was amongst the best cinema I have ever seen, across the board. It vastly outstripped one (1) and two (2). Anyway, I was perplexed when I found out that Dune 3 was still in production and not slated for release for circa twelve (12) months. Like lightning, I realised that I had likely seen the first featurelength AI Generated cinematic simulacrum or longform deepfake. I immediately, realised it was my civic and civil responsibility to report it to all tiers of governance in Australia. So, I endeavoured to do that for a whole business day. The abject and consummate farce I experienced revealed that the populace of Melbourne, Victoria and Australia are in grave peril and that the balance of politicians are inept, corrupt and asleep at the wheel. Longform deepfake realtime-generated GenAI that is indistinguishable from reality is already here and has likely been so for quite some, that is, a few years. I then realised, if we do not archive, preserve and seal with veracity and probity, all: books, photographs, audiovisuals and audio, etc., human culture and the historical legacy of the ages may just be overwritten and the balance of Humanity will be none the wiser. Do you appreciate how precarious our citation is? There are so many other things and scenarios I could warn about, but this pith, captures all that is of immediate import. Bar, why aren't the populace being informed and trained in view and light of this new grave peril?

Sincerely

# Everything Open Conference: Vision, Purpose and Function #

Everything Open is Australia's premier grassroots conference dedicated to open technologies. Organized by volunteers under the auspices of Linux Australia, it is a not-for-profit event designed to bring together diverse communities who share a passion for open source principles and practices.

## Vision ##

To foster an inclusive and dynamic environment where the global open technologies community can converge, collaborate, and inspire positive change, embodying the values of openness, respect, and community to shape a better digital landscape.

## Purpose ##

The core purpose of the conference is to provide a physical and intellectual space for community members, industry leaders and enthusiasts, to come together to: learn, share and connect around all facets of open technologies.

**Key objectives include:**

* Knowledge Sharing: Disseminating the latest ground-breaking insights and updates on mature and emergent open technologies, from project contributors and experts.
* Community Building: Strengthening connections between individuals and groups within the open technology ecosystems, promoting collaboration and breaking down traditional silos between different sectors.
* Promoting Values: Upholding and advocating for the core philosophies and values of free and open source, including open source software, open hardware, open data, open government, and more.
* Education and Skill Enhancement: Offering diverse presentations, from highly technical deep-dives into the Linux kernel to hands-on tutorials and business-focused case studies, to enhance technical competence and capability across all skill levels.

## Function ##

**The conference functions primarily as a three-day event featuring a variety of structured and informal activities:**

* Diverse Program Streams: A wide array of scheduled presentations (both short and long talks) and interactive tutorials covering topics like the Linux ecosystem, open hardware, open data, open GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums), and community management.
* Networking Opportunities: Facilitating the "hallway track" where informal interactions and discussions occur between formal sessions, allowing for vital networking and relationship building.
* Accessibility and Inclusivity: Striving to be an inclusive event that welcomes diverse participants, with an enforced Code of Conduct to ensure an atmosphere of trust, safety, and respect for all attendees.
* Content Dissemination: Recording sessions and making them publicly available after the event under a Creative Commons license, extending the reach and impact of the shared knowledge beyond the physical attendees.
