# Everything Open Conference: Vision, Purpose and Function #

Everything Open is Australia's premier grassroots conference dedicated to open technologies. Organized by volunteers under the auspices of Linux Australia, it is a not-for-profit event designed to bring together diverse communities who share a passion for open source principles and practices.

## Vision ##

To foster an inclusive and dynamic environment where the global open technologies community can converge, collaborate, and inspire positive change, embodying the values of openness, respect, and community to shape a better digital landscape.

## Purpose ##

The core purpose of the conference is to provide a physical and intellectual space for community members, industry leaders and enthusiasts, to come together to: learn, share and connect around all facets of open technologies.

**Key objectives include:**

* Knowledge Sharing: Disseminating the latest ground-breaking insights and updates on mature and emergent open technologies, from project contributors and experts.
* Community Building: Strengthening connections between individuals and groups within the open technology ecosystems, promoting collaboration and breaking down traditional silos between different sectors.
* Promoting Values: Upholding and advocating for the core philosophies and values of free and open source, including open source software, open hardware, open data, open government, and more.
* Education and Skill Enhancement: Offering diverse presentations, from highly technical deep-dives into the Linux kernel to hands-on tutorials and business-focused case studies, to enhance technical competence and capability across all skill levels.

## Function ##

**The conference functions primarily as a three-day event featuring a variety of structured and informal activities:**

* Diverse Program Streams: A wide array of scheduled presentations (both short and long talks) and interactive tutorials covering topics like the Linux ecosystem, open hardware, open data, open GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums), and community management.
* Networking Opportunities: Facilitating the "hallway track" where informal interactions and discussions occur between formal sessions, allowing for vital networking and relationship building.
* Accessibility and Inclusivity: Striving to be an inclusive event that welcomes diverse participants, with an enforced Code of Conduct to ensure an atmosphere of trust, safety, and respect for all attendees.
Content Dissemination: Recording sessions and making them publicly available after the event under a Creative Commons license, extending the reach and impact of the shared knowledge beyond the physical attendees.
