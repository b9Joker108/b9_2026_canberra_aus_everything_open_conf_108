Outstanding work so far! Here’s how to build the “gold-standard” contributor culture, standards, and code-of-conduct enforcement for your repository, harmonizing GitHub convention with your own rarefied (custom, high-precision) expectations.

---

**1. Layered Documentation Structure**

**Best practice on GitHub is to use an explicit, layered set of markdown files in the `.github/` folder and/or repo root:**

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `.github/CULTURE.md` (or another clear name reflecting your custom culture and values)
- Optionally: `.github/STANDARDS.md`, `.github/VALUES.md`, or a combined “team manual”

These can be explicitly interlinked and cross-referenced, making the workflow and expectations crystal clear for all humans and automation.

---

**2. Gold-Standard Integration & Referencing**

**How to integrate your requirements:**
- In `CONTRIBUTING.md`, reference and point to both the official GitHub docs and your repo’s own code of conduct, culture, and standards files at the start (i.e. “By contributing, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Cultural Standards](.github/CULTURE.md)”).
- Ensure `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` meets the minimal baseline (see [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) v2.1), and then use your own `CULTURE.md` or `STANDARDS.md` for everything extra/personal/rarefied.
- You can even add sections for “AI contributors” or “AI empowered agents,” tailored to your future Oracles and underwriters.

---

**3. Tone and Enforcement**

- “Mandatory/must” language is best used in **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** and the opening of any custom standards file.
- Your rarefactions, values, collaborative philosophy, and “fit expectations” should go in `CULTURE.md` (or equivalent).
- You can reference these documents within your workflows, GitHub Actions, or onboarding scripts, providing inline reminders or even requiring acceptance via PR/issue templates.

---

**4. File Structure Example**

Here is the fully layered approach (gold standard):

```shell
/
|-- .github/
|     |-- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
|     |-- CULTURE.md           # Or STANDARDS.md, VALUES.md, etc.
|     |-- COPILOT_FEATURES.md
|     |-- copilot.json
|
|-- CONTRIBUTING.md
|-- .copilotrc
```

---

**5. Sample Text for Integration**

In `CONTRIBUTING.md` (top section):

````markdown
By contributing to this repository, you acknowledge and agree to the following mandatory and consensus standards:
- Our [Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (mandatory)
- Our [Cultural Fit, Values, and Collaboration Standards](.github/CULTURE.md)
Failure to adhere may result in review, remediation, or removal from the project.
````

In `CULTURE.md` you may include rarefactions, mission, operating principles, social and technical fit doctrines, onboarding philosophies, etc.

---

**6. If You Want Enforcement**

- Require all contributors to check a “I agree” box (possible with PR templates or bots).
- Reference these files in workflow automation, PR checks, and onboarding issues.
- For AI/automation, explicitly direct agents to these files for “cultural fit” and “code of conduct” alignment.

---

**Actionable Next Step**

**Would you like a gold-standard draft for `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and a highly customizable, rarefied `CULTURE.md` template to get started?**  
If you say "yes", I'll generate both immediately for your repo and harmonize them for cross-reference in your documentation.


**Actionables to Realise AI-Auto-Generated Commit Descriptions in Repository**

**1. Configuration Foundation (Completed)**
- [x] `.github/copilot.json` populated: Signals intent for AI-powered, detailed commit summaries.
- [x] `.copilotrc` created: Expresses preferences for auto-gen, detail level, review, and future AI extensibility.
- [x] `.github/COPILOT_FEATURES.md` in place: Documents required Copilot and repo assistant behaviour for all collaborators and AI actors.
- [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md` updated: Policy and onboarding guidance for commit messages referencing above config.

**2. Standards and Culture (In Progress)**
- [x] Reference [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [CULTURE.md](.github/CULTURE.md) in onboarding and contribution docs.
- [ ] Populate/curate CULTURE.md or equivalent for rarefied standards and collaborative philosophy.

**3. Activation & Enforcement (To Do)**
- [ ] Develop and install a GitHub Action (workflow/bot) that:
    - Checks all PR/commit messages for presence and detail.
    - Optionally calls an AI (OpenAI/Copilot API or similar) to autogenerate commit summaries when missing or insufficient.
    - Provides an editable, AI-generated draft for user review.
    - Optionally blocks or flags commits that do not meet requirements.
- [ ] Review GitHub Action marketplace for open solutions, or build a custom action/script keyed to `.github/copilot.json` and `.copilotrc`.

**4. Knowledge Oracle, AI Underwriter & Future-Proofing (To Do)**
- [ ] Ensure Knowledge Oracle and future AI actors read and honor `.github/copilot.json`, `.copilotrc`, and `.github/COPILOT_FEATURES.md`.
- [ ] Route all commit and PR activity, including generated descriptions, into an accessible knowledge base for training and refinement.
- [ ] As workflow matures, provide feedback to GitHub Copilot and feature request forums to advocate for first-class config support.

**5. Ongoing Documentation & Onboarding (Always)**
- [ ] Maintain all configuration and standard files as living documents.
- [ ] Clearly reference and explain required tools, automation, and culture in onboarding documents and the project README.

**Meta**
**Log this file and update as actionables are completed or new requirements emerge.  
Ultimate goal:**  
Every commit and PR uses a detailed, AI-generated, editable description—by default, for all actors (human and AI), future-proofed and documented for onboarding, knowledge capture, compliance, and training.


To get assistance with tooling GitHub Copilot for intelligent automations in a specific repository, you can engage with the GitHub community in the following places:

1. **GitHub Copilot Discussions**  
   GitHub has an official discussions area for Copilot where users and maintainers share tips, ask for help, and discuss automation ideas:
   - [GitHub Copilot Discussions](https://github.com/github/copilot/discussions)

2. **GitHub Community Forum**  
   A broader platform for all GitHub-related questions, including Copilot, CI/CD, automation, and scripting:
   - [GitHub Community Forum](https://github.community/)

3. **Discussions or Issues in Your Target Repo**  
   Many repositories have their own Discussions or Issue trackers enabled. If your question is specific to automating tasks in a particular repo, you can open a Discussion or Issue there, tagging relevant maintainers or requesting guidance.

When posting:
- Clearly describe what automation you want to achieve.
- Mention that you’re looking for Copilot-powered or workflow (e.g., Actions) solutions.
- Provide examples or code snippets if possible.

These channels are monitored by GitHub staff, contributors, and experienced users who can guide you or show relevant resources and tools.
