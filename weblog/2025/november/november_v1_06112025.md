Outstanding work so far! Here’s how to build the “gold-standard” contributor culture, standards, and code-of-conduct enforcement for your repository, harmonizing GitHub convention with your own rarefied (custom, high-precision) expectations.

---

**1. Layered Documentation Structure**

**Best practice on GitHub is to use an explicit, layered set of markdown files in the `.github/` folder and/or repo root:**

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `.github/CULTURE.md` (or another clear name reflecting your custom culture and values)
- Optionally: `.github/STANDARDS.md`, `.github/VALUES.md`, or a combined “team manual”

These can be explicitly interlinked and cross-referenced, making the workflow and expectations crystal clear for all humans and automation.

---

**2. Gold-Standard Integration & Referencing**

**How to integrate your requirements:**
- In `CONTRIBUTING.md`, reference and point to both the official GitHub docs and your repo’s own code of conduct, culture, and standards files at the start (i.e. “By contributing, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Cultural Standards](.github/CULTURE.md)”).
- Ensure `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` meets the minimal baseline (see [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) v2.1), and then use your own `CULTURE.md` or `STANDARDS.md` for everything extra/personal/rarefied.
- You can even add sections for “AI contributors” or “AI empowered agents,” tailored to your future Oracles and underwriters.

---

**3. Tone and Enforcement**

- “Mandatory/must” language is best used in **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** and the opening of any custom standards file.
- Your rarefactions, values, collaborative philosophy, and “fit expectations” should go in `CULTURE.md` (or equivalent).
- You can reference these documents within your workflows, GitHub Actions, or onboarding scripts, providing inline reminders or even requiring acceptance via PR/issue templates.

---

**4. File Structure Example**

Here is the fully layered approach (gold standard):

```shell
/
|-- .github/
|     |-- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
|     |-- CULTURE.md           # Or STANDARDS.md, VALUES.md, etc.
|     |-- COPILOT_FEATURES.md
|     |-- copilot.json
|
|-- CONTRIBUTING.md
|-- .copilotrc
```

---

**5. Sample Text for Integration**

In `CONTRIBUTING.md` (top section):

````markdown
By contributing to this repository, you acknowledge and agree to the following mandatory and consensus standards:
- Our [Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (mandatory)
- Our [Cultural Fit, Values, and Collaboration Standards](.github/CULTURE.md)
Failure to adhere may result in review, remediation, or removal from the project.
````

In `CULTURE.md` you may include rarefactions, mission, operating principles, social and technical fit doctrines, onboarding philosophies, etc.

---

**6. If You Want Enforcement**

- Require all contributors to check a “I agree” box (possible with PR templates or bots).
- Reference these files in workflow automation, PR checks, and onboarding issues.
- For AI/automation, explicitly direct agents to these files for “cultural fit” and “code of conduct” alignment.

---

**Actionable Next Step**

**Would you like a gold-standard draft for `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and a highly customizable, rarefied `CULTURE.md` template to get started?**  
If you say "yes", I'll generate both immediately for your repo and harmonize them for cross-reference in your documentation.


**Actionables to Realise AI-Auto-Generated Commit Descriptions in Repository**

**1. Configuration Foundation (Completed)**
- [x] `.github/copilot.json` populated: Signals intent for AI-powered, detailed commit summaries.
- [x] `.copilotrc` created: Expresses preferences for auto-gen, detail level, review, and future AI extensibility.
- [x] `.github/COPILOT_FEATURES.md` in place: Documents required Copilot and repo assistant behaviour for all collaborators and AI actors.
- [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md` updated: Policy and onboarding guidance for commit messages referencing above config.

**2. Standards and Culture (In Progress)**
- [x] Reference [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [CULTURE.md](.github/CULTURE.md) in onboarding and contribution docs.
- [ ] Populate/curate CULTURE.md or equivalent for rarefied standards and collaborative philosophy.

**3. Activation & Enforcement (To Do)**
- [ ] Develop and install a GitHub Action (workflow/bot) that:
    - Checks all PR/commit messages for presence and detail.
    - Optionally calls an AI (OpenAI/Copilot API or similar) to autogenerate commit summaries when missing or insufficient.
    - Provides an editable, AI-generated draft for user review.
    - Optionally blocks or flags commits that do not meet requirements.
- [ ] Review GitHub Action marketplace for open solutions, or build a custom action/script keyed to `.github/copilot.json` and `.copilotrc`.

**4. Knowledge Oracle, AI Underwriter & Future-Proofing (To Do)**
- [ ] Ensure Knowledge Oracle and future AI actors read and honor `.github/copilot.json`, `.copilotrc`, and `.github/COPILOT_FEATURES.md`.
- [ ] Route all commit and PR activity, including generated descriptions, into an accessible knowledge base for training and refinement.
- [ ] As workflow matures, provide feedback to GitHub Copilot and feature request forums to advocate for first-class config support.

**5. Ongoing Documentation & Onboarding (Always)**
- [ ] Maintain all configuration and standard files as living documents.
- [ ] Clearly reference and explain required tools, automation, and culture in onboarding documents and the project README.

---

**Meta**
**Log this file and update as actionables are completed or new requirements emerge.  
Ultimate goal:**  
Every commit and PR uses a detailed, AI-generated, editable description—by default, for all actors (human and AI), future-proofed and documented for onboarding, knowledge capture, compliance, and training.


To get assistance with tooling GitHub Copilot for intelligent automations in a specific repository, you can engage with the GitHub community in the following places:

1. **GitHub Copilot Discussions**  
   GitHub has an official discussions area for Copilot where users and maintainers share tips, ask for help, and discuss automation ideas:
   - [GitHub Copilot Discussions](https://github.com/github/copilot/discussions)

2. **GitHub Community Forum**  
   A broader platform for all GitHub-related questions, including Copilot, CI/CD, automation, and scripting:
   - [GitHub Community Forum](https://github.community/)

3. **Discussions or Issues in Your Target Repo**  
   Many repositories have their own Discussions or Issue trackers enabled. If your question is specific to automating tasks in a particular repo, you can open a Discussion or Issue there, tagging relevant maintainers or requesting guidance.

When posting:
- Clearly describe what automation you want to achieve.
- Mention that you’re looking for Copilot-powered or workflow (e.g., Actions) solutions.
- Provide examples or code snippets if possible.

These channels are monitored by GitHub staff, contributors, and experienced users who can guide you or show relevant resources and tools.

Quick Answer:  
The Everything Open 2026 conference will be held in Canberra, Australia from January 21–23, 2026. As of today (November 6, 2025), that’s 76 days away. You can add a simple automated countdown to your GitHub README using lightweight Markdown badges or a GitHub Action that updates daily.

---

🗓 Days Until the Conference
- Conference dates: January 21–23, 2026  
- Location: Canberra, ACT, Australia  
- Days remaining (from Nov 6, 2025): 76 days

---

⚙️ How to Add a Countdown to Your GitHub README

There are a few modest, reproducible approaches you can use:

1. Static Badge (Manual Update)
- Use a Markdown badge generator like shields.io.
- Example Markdown snippet:
  ```markdown
  !Countdown
  ```
- You’ll need to update the number manually, but it’s quick and visually neat.

---

2. GitHub Action (Automated Update)
If you want the countdown to update automatically each day:

1. Create a script (e.g., countdown.py) that calculates days remaining:
   ```python
   from datetime import date

   event_date = date(2026, 1, 21)
   today = date.today()
   daysleft = (eventdate - today).days

   with open("README.md", "r") as f:
       lines = f.readlines()

   with open("README.md", "w") as f:
       for line in lines:
           if line.startswith("![Countdown]"):
               f.write(f"!Countdown\n")
           else:
               f.write(line)
   ```

2. Add a GitHub Action workflow (.github/workflows/countdown.yml):
   ```yaml
   name: Update Countdown
   on:
     schedule:
       - cron: "0 0   *"   # runs daily at midnight UTC
   jobs:
     update:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
           with:
             python-version: '3.x'
         - run: python countdown.py
         - run: |
             git config --global user.name 'github-actions[bot]'
             git config --global user.email 'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com'
             git add README.md
             git commit -m "Update countdown"
             git push
   ```

This way, your README will always show the correct number of days left without manual intervention.

---

3. Minimalist Text Update
If you prefer simplicity without badges:
```markdown
Days until Everything Open 2026 in Canberra: 76
```
Then automate with the same GitHub Action approach.

---

✅ Recommendation
For a modest but automated solution, I’d suggest the GitHub Action + shields.io badge combo. It’s reproducible, visually clear, and requires no manual upkeep—perfect for your archival and workflow standards.

Would you like me to draft a ready-to-paste README snippet that combines the badge and text countdown in one clean section?

Perfect — let’s make this countdown section clean, reproducible, and README‑ready. Here’s a snippet you can paste directly into your README.md:

```markdown

🗓 Countdown to Everything Open 2026

!Countdown

Days until Everything Open 2026 in Canberra: 76  
📍 January 21–23, 2026 — Canberra, ACT, Australia
```

---

🔄 How to Keep It Updated
- Manual: Just change the number 76 in both places when you feel like it.  
- Automated: Use the Python + GitHub Action workflow I outlined earlier. That way, the badge and text will refresh daily without you lifting a finger.

---

🧾 Why This Works Well
- Modest: No heavy dependencies, just Markdown + shields.io.  
- Readable: Badge gives a quick visual, text gives archival clarity.  
- Reproducible: The GitHub Action ensures it stays current, which fits your protocol‑driven style.

---

Would you like me to extend this into a full GitHub Action starter kit (with the Python script and workflow file already aligned to this snippet), so you can drop it straight into your repo and have it run?

Excellent — let’s build you a ready‑to‑drop starter kit so your README countdown stays fresh automatically. Here’s the complete setup:

---

1. README Snippet
Paste this into your README.md:

```markdown

🗓 Countdown to Everything Open 2026

!Countdown

Days until Everything Open 2026 in Canberra: 76  
📍 January 21–23, 2026 — Canberra, ACT, Australia
```

---

2. Countdown Script (countdown.py)
Create a small Python script in your repo root:

`python
from datetime import date

event_date = date(2026, 1, 21)
today = date.today()
daysleft = (eventdate - today).days

badgeline = f"!Countdown\n"
textline = f"Days until Everything Open 2026 in Canberra: {daysleft}  \n📍 January 21–23, 2026 — Canberra, ACT, Australia\n"

with open("README.md", "r") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

with open("README.md", "w") as f:
    for line in lines:
        if line.startswith("![Countdown]"):
            f.write(badge_line)
        elif line.startswith("Days until Everything Open"):
            f.write(text_line)
        else:
            f.write(line)
```

This script recalculates the days left and rewrites the badge + text lines.

---

3. GitHub Action Workflow (.github/workflows/countdown.yml)
Add this workflow file:

```yaml
name: Update Countdown
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0   *"   # runs daily at midnight UTC
  workflow_dispatch:       # allows manual trigger
jobs:
  update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - run: python countdown.py
      - run: |
          git config --global user.name 'github-actions[bot]'
          git config --global user.email 'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com'
          git add README.md
          git commit -m "Update countdown"
          git push
```

---

4. How It Works
- Every midnight UTC, GitHub runs the workflow.  
- The Python script recalculates days left.  
- README is updated and pushed back to your repo.  
- Badge + text always stay current without manual edits.

---

✅ Result
Your README will show a live countdown that ticks down daily until Everything Open 2026 begins in Canberra. It’s modest, reproducible, and fully automated.

---

Would you like me to also add a failsafe so the badge switches to a celebratory “It’s happening now!” message once the conference starts, instead of going negative?
