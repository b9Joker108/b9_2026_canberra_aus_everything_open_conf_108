When a pull request (PR) is merged into your repository, the changes made in that PR—including any code, files, or artefacts—should appear in the branch that the PR was merged into (usually the main or default branch). If you cannot see the artefacts (files, folders, etc.) from the merged PR in your repo, here are some common reasons:

1. **Branch Mismatch**:  
   - The PR may have been merged into a branch other than the one you are currently viewing (e.g., merged into `main`, but you are looking at `develop` or another branch).
   - Solution: Check which branch the PR was merged into and ensure you are viewing that branch in your repository.

2. **Local Clone Not Updated**:  
   - If you are viewing your repo locally (on your computer), you might not have pulled the latest changes.
   - Solution: Run `git pull origin main` (or the target branch) to fetch the latest changes.

3. **Web Interface Cached / Outdated**:  
   - Sometimes, browser caching can cause the GitHub web interface to not show the most recent changes immediately.
   - Solution: Refresh the page, try a hard reload, or clear browser cache.

4. **PR Content Was Not Actually Added**:  
   - The PR might have been merged, but if the changes involved only structural changes (like adding folders without files, or updating non-visible metadata), you may not see obvious artefacts.
   - Solution: Review the PR's "Files changed" tab to confirm what was actually added, modified, or deleted.

5. **Artefacts Are in a Subdirectory**:  
   - The changes may have been added to a subdirectory or a different location in your repo than expected.
   - Solution: Browse the full repo tree or search for specific files.

6. **Merge Commit Was Reverted**:  
   - After merging, someone may have reverted the merge commit, removing the artefacts.
   - Solution: Check the commit history for any revert actions.

**How to Check:**
- Go to your repo: [b9Joker108/b9_2026_canberra_aus_everything_open_conf_108](https://github.com/b9Joker108/b9_2026_canberra_aus_everything_open_conf_108)
- Check the branch selector (top-left) and make sure you are on the branch into which PR #1 was merged.
- Review the commit history to confirm the merge.
- Use the "Files changed" tab on [PR #1](https://github.com/b9Joker108/b9_2026_canberra_aus_everything_open_conf_108/pull/1) to see what artefacts should have been added.

If you want, I can help inspect the repo and provide details about the merged artefacts—just let me know!
